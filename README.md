# CPU Scheduling Algorithms

## Functionalities
- 7 Algorithms are implemented.
- Each process can have different number of CPU Burst Time and I/O Burst Time.
- Gantt Chart and Timeline Chart for the given Schedule.
- Animation of the Time Log.
- Comparison between all the algorithms wrt Average Completion Time, Turn Around Time, Waiting Time and Response Time.


### Different Criteria and Algorithms
  - **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
    >Non-Preemptive
  - **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
    >Non-Preemptive
  - **Shortest Remaining Job First (SRJF)**
    >Preemptive
  - **Longest Job First (LJF)**
    >Non-Preemptive
  - **Longest Remaining Job First (LRJF)**
    >Preemptive
  - **Priority Non-Preemptive (PNP)**
    >Non-Preemptive
  - **Round Robin (RR)**
    >Preemptive
  - **Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)**
    >Non-Preemptive
